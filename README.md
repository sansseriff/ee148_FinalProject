# PhotonNet

A convolutional neural network that takes in a set of data analogous to what would be 
generated by a time resolved image sensor and outputs a flow field that
 estimates the motion of imaged objects over a short time period. 
 
 A time resolved image sensor is a device like a SNSPD or SPAD array that outputs pulses
  corresponding to photon detections at specific pixel locations. The detection
  time of individual photons tends to be high precision, but the total throughput of these types
  of arrays tends to be low. 


## Built Using
